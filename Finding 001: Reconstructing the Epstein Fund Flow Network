**Database:** 23,832 fund flow records extracted, 675 high-confidence

## Summary

Automated financial extraction across the full EFTA corpus produced **23,832 directional fund flow records** — extracted transactions with a sender, receiver, amount, and date — totaling $10.73B in extracted volume across 19 datasets and 1,831,659 files.

These records map **who moved money to whom, through which banks, and in what amounts.** This is the first automated reconstruction of the Epstein financial network from the EFTA corpus. No other independent project has produced directional fund flow data at this scale.

**Critical caveat:** The $10.73B figure is extracted volume, not deduplicated transaction volume. The same wire transfer can appear in a bank statement, an email confirmation, a wire request, and a legal filing — generating multiple records. Of 23,832 entries, only 675 (2.5%) are high confidence, anchored by bank production documents, totaling $267M. This $267M represents the verified floor. The network topology — who connects to whom — is more reliable than the aggregate dollar amounts.

Key findings:

1. **Ghislaine Maxwell is the largest documented recipient in the network** — appearing in 2,194 fund flow records as a receiver. She also appears as a sender in 510 records, indicating extensive bidirectional financial activity with Epstein's accounts.

2. **Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan processed the majority of flows.** Deutsche Bank appears as a sender in 2,311 records; JPMorgan in 795. Deutsche Bank's extracted volume exceeds its known ~$400M SAR filing by a ratio of 3.7:1, suggesting the bank processed substantial Epstein-related activity it did not flag as suspicious.

3. **Three financial gatekeepers form the operational routing layer**: accountant Richard Kahn (1,260 fund flow records), attorney Darren Indyke (460 records), and assistant Eileen Alexanderson (139 records). These individuals were the human infrastructure between Epstein's banks and his network.

4. **162 fund flow entries record amounts of exactly $500,000**, totaling $81M. This clustering at a round threshold is statistically anomalous and warrants investigation into whether it reflects bank compliance caps, pipeline extraction artifacts, or deliberate transaction structuring.

## Methodology

### Source Data

The fund flow table (`fund_flows`) was populated by the v18 pipeline's financial extraction phases, processing the corpus across multiple passes. Each fund flow record contains:
- `entity_from` / `entity_to`: Sender and receiver (normalized)
- `amount`: Dollar value
- `date_ref`: Transaction date reference from source document
- `confidence`: `high` or `low` based on extraction quality
- `file_id` / `serial` / `page_num`: Full source citation chain

### Fund Flow Inventory

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total entries | 23,832 |
| Total extracted volume | $10,728,214,608 |
| High confidence entries | 675 ($267,244,458) |
| Low confidence entries | 23,157 ($10,460,970,150) |

By source dataset:
| Dataset | Entries | Extracted Volume |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| DS9 (DOJ email/NPA evidence) | 17,589 | $8,380,013,523 |
| DS10 (seized device media) | 4,904 | $1,808,210,619 |
| DS8 (FBI/Palm Beach evidence) | 310 | $498,491,235 |
| DS11 (financial/flight/property) | 1,017 | $26,277,176 |
| DS12 (late productions) | 11 | $15,221,805 |
| DS4 | 1 | $250 |

### Confidence Distribution

| Confidence | Entries | Amount | Share |
|------------|---------|--------|-------|
| High | 675 | $267M | 2.5% |
| Low | 23,157 | $10,461M | 97.5% |

**Important caveat:** 97.5% of entries are classified as low confidence. Low-confidence entries are extracted from context where the sender-receiver-amount triple could not be fully verified against structured financial documents. The network topology (who connects to whom) is more reliable than the specific dollar amounts in the low-confidence tier.

The high-confidence entries ($267M from 675 records) are sourced primarily from bank production documents (DB-SDNY, JPM-SDNYLIT series) and represent the verified floor of financial activity in the corpus.

## Finding 1: Ghislaine Maxwell — Largest Network Recipient

Maxwell appears in more fund flow records as a receiver than any other entity in the network:

| Rank | Receiver | Records | Extracted Volume |
|------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Ghislaine Maxwell** | **2,194** | $758,531,027 |
| 2 | Southern Financial LLC | 901 | $677,344,623 |
| 3 | Leon Black | 330 | $564,647,533 |
| 4 | Debra Black | 157 | $560,509,993 |
| 5 | The Haze Trust | 321 | $536,019,148 |
| 6 | Bank of America | 497 | $534,006,487 |
| 7 | JPMorgan | 705 | $342,716,349 |
| 8 | Scott Stackman | 880 | $318,814,783 |
| 9 | Southern Trust Company | 302 | $318,789,664 |
| 10 | Lexington Ave (property) | 544 | $228,819,146 |

**Important:** The dollar amounts in this table are extracted volume — they include duplication from the same transaction appearing across multiple source documents. The record counts (how many documents reference each entity as a receiver) are the more reliable metric.

Maxwell also appears as a sender in 510 records, indicating bidirectional financial activity. The 2,194 receiver records are consistent with the forensic accounting presented in *United States v. Maxwell* (S2 20 Cr. 330, SDNY), where the government documented years of financial transfers from Epstein to Maxwell through multiple bank accounts.

**Context:** During Maxwell's trial, expert forensic accountant Jorge Amador identified at least $25M in documented payments from Epstein to Maxwell through JPMorgan accounts alone. The 2,194 fund flow records across the full EFTA corpus — spanning multiple banks and entities — suggest these known payments represent a fraction of the documented financial relationship.

Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on five of six counts including sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy. She was sentenced to 20 years.

## Finding 2: Bank Routing Infrastructure

### Deutsche Bank — 2,311 Fund Flow Records

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fund flow records (as sender) | 2,311 |
| Extracted volume (sent) | $1,475,373,584 |
| Known SAR filing | ~$400M |
| **Extraction-to-SAR ratio** | **3.7x** |

Deutsche Bank maintained Epstein as a client from 2013 to 2018, years after his 2008 conviction and years after JPMorgan terminated him. The bank paid $75M to settle a 2020 lawsuit brought by Epstein's victims who alleged the bank knowingly facilitated his trafficking operation.

The 3.7x ratio between extracted volume and known SAR filing does not mean the pipeline found $1.5B in unique transactions — it means Deutsche Bank appears as a sender across 2,311 fund flow records totaling that amount, which includes duplication from the same transaction appearing in multiple documents. However, even accounting for duplication, the volume suggests Deutsche Bank processed substantial Epstein-related activity beyond what it reported to FinCEN as suspicious.

### JPMorgan — 795 Fund Flow Records

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fund flow records (as sender) | 795 |
| Extracted volume (sent) | $933,057,678 |
| Fund flow records (as receiver) | 705 |
| Extracted volume (received) | $342,716,349 |
| Known SAR filing (post-arrest) | $1,100,000,000 |
| **Extraction-to-SAR ratio** | **0.85x** |

JPMorgan filed SARs covering $1.1B in suspicious wire transfers in August-September 2019 — **after** Epstein's arrest. The bank had maintained Epstein as a client from 1998 to 2013 without filing a single SAR for five years between May 2003 and September 2008. The 0.85x ratio (pipeline extracted less than SAR benchmark) is consistent with expectations — some wire records may remain sealed or were not included in the DOJ release.

JPMorgan paid $290M to settle a 2023 class action by Epstein's victims.

## Finding 3: The $500,000 Threshold Cluster

**162 fund flow entries record amounts of exactly $500,000, totaling $81,000,000.**

This clustering at a round number is statistically anomalous. In normal financial data, transaction amounts follow a power-law distribution — amounts cluster at small values and thin out at larger ones, but do not spike at specific round thresholds.

Three possible explanations:

1. **Bank compliance caps:** Some banks' internal compliance systems flagged or required enhanced due diligence for wire transfers above $500K. Epstein's financial operators may have structured transactions to stay at or below this threshold.

2. **Extraction artifact:** The pipeline's Tier 3 entity-matching may have a cap or rounding behavior at $500K. This requires audit against source documents.

3. **Deliberate structuring:** Epstein's known pattern of structuring cash withdrawals below the $10,000 Currency Transaction Report (CTR) threshold suggests sophistication in evading reporting triggers. A $500K wire threshold could reflect awareness of bank-specific enhanced monitoring levels.

Regardless of cause, the 162 capped entries represent **$81M in transactions that require manual review** against source documents to determine their true amounts.

## Finding 4: The Financial Gatekeeper Layer

Three individuals appear repeatedly as intermediaries — routing money between Epstein's banks and his broader network:

| Gatekeeper | Role | Records (sent) | Records (recv) | Total Records |
|------------|------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Richard Kahn | Accountant/Trustee | 501 | 759 | 1,260 |
| Darren Indyke | Attorney/Trustee | 460 | — | 460 |
| Eileen Alexanderson | Financial assistant | 139 | — | 139 |

Kahn and Indyke are the co-executors of Epstein's estate. Both have been subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee. Kahn is scheduled to testify before Congress in February 2026.

The record counts tell the story: Kahn appears in 1,260 fund flow records — more than JPMorgan (795 as sender + 705 as receiver = 1,500) and nearly as many as Deutsche Bank (2,311 as sender). These are not principals — they are the operational layer that executed transactions on behalf of Epstein's network.

Alexanderson's appearance in 139 records as a sender is notable — she held no principal role, yet repeatedly originated fund movements. This pattern is consistent with the use of staff members as transaction originators to obscure Epstein's direct involvement.

## Limitations

1. **Low-confidence entries dominate.** 97.5% of fund flow records are low confidence. The network topology is more reliable than specific dollar amounts.

2. **Not all flows are unique transactions.** The same wire may appear in multiple documents (bank statement, email confirmation, wire transfer request). Composite deduplication reduces but does not eliminate this duplication.

3. **Fund flows ≠ illicit flows.** Many extracted transactions are legitimate (legal fees, property management, trust distributions). The pipeline does not classify transactions as legal or illegal — it maps the network.

4. **SAR benchmarks are incomplete.** The $1.878B SAR benchmark is derived from public filings by JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, and BNY Mellon. Other banks (UBS, Citibank, First Republic, Charles Schwab) also maintained Epstein accounts but their SAR filings are not fully public.

5. **DS103 excluded.** The House Oversight release includes Trump financial disclosures (DS103) which are not Epstein-related. These are excluded from all financial analysis.

## Source Citations

Fund flow data is extracted from EFTA documents across all 12 DOJ datasets. Key source document series:

- **DB-SDNY production** (Tier 1): Deutsche Bank litigation discovery, SDNY case documents
- **JPM-SDNYLIT-W series**: JPMorgan litigation discovery, wire transfer records
- **DS11 financial ledgers**: Account statements, wire confirmations, trust documents
- **DS9 email correspondence**: Wire transfer requests, payment confirmations, account discussions

Individual EFTA citations are available for every fund flow record via the `serial` and `page_num` fields in the database.
